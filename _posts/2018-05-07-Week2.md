## What is it for?

Community bonding period is all about, as the name suggests bonding with org's community. This is a 3-week period where students and mentors share their ideas about the project, it's workflow and implementation. 


## Week 1

During this week, I scheduled my first video call with my mentors. We shared a little bit about ourselves. We discussed about the scope of this project and what are the different directions of improvment which can be done during the course of this project tenure.

I spent the remaining time of this week in knowing about DBpedia and the role & other whereabouts of my project. This included,

* Reading about SPARQL
* Reading NSpM research paper



## Week 2
