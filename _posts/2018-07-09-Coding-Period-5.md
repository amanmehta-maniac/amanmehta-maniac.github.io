Keeping in mind our ultimate goal of this project - We want to automatically generate training data using a single command or a sinlge script, it is important to devise another script which will automatically perform all the sub-tasks. In the current scenario, there are different scripts which perform a sub-task each in a serial fashion to five us the required training set. To club this in a single script, it is important to address each of the subtask and reduce the hard-coded portions and properly define all the parameters.
