## What is it?

This period marks the beginning of actual coding that will be happening. After knowing more about the community, it's coding standards and discussing expectations from this project, I will begin with the coding aspect of the project.

Deliverables completed:

* Learning complex SPARQL querying
* Build python scripts to automatically fetch metadata for a subset of properties of Place and Person class 
* Stored them in a JSON dump of dictionary




* Found out few bugs while quering DBpedia SPARQL
